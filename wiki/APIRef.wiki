= Introduction =

The public AWS4C functions are divided into four groups:

    * [APIRef#Configuration_Functions Configuration Functions]
    * [APIRef#S3_Interface_Functions S3 Interface Functions]
    * [APIRef#SQS_Interface_Functions SQS Interface Functions]
    * [APIRef#IO+Buffer+Functions I/O Buffer Functions] 


== Configuration Functions ==

===aws_init===
void aws_init  (  )   	

Initialize the library. This function must be the first AWS4C function called.

===aws_read_config===
int aws_read_config 	( char *const   	id  )  	

Read AWS authentication records.

Parameters:
    	id 	user ID


This function loads AWS authentication credentials corresponding to the user given user ID   from ~/.awsAuth file.   All subsequent S3 and SQS operations will use these crendentials.
This function must be called before the first SQS or S3 operation.   It could be called again when the credential switch is required.

See [DevGuide#Authentication_Keys Developer's Guide] for details about ‘~/.awsAuth’ file.

===aws_set_debug====

===aws_set_id====
