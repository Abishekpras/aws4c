= Introduction =

The public AWS4C functions are divided into four groups:

    * [APIRef#Configuration_Functions Configuration Functions]
    * [APIRef#S3_Interface_Functions S3 Interface Functions]
    * [APIRef#SQS_Interface_Functions SQS Interface Functions]
    * [APIRef#IO+Buffer+Functions I/O Buffer Functions] 


== Configuration Functions ==

===aws_init===
void aws_init  (  )   	

Initialize the library. This function must be the first AWS4C function called.

===aws_read_config===

_int *aws_read_config* 	( char '*' const id  )_  	

Read AWS authentication records.

Parameters:
    	_id_ 	user ID


This function loads AWS authentication credentials corresponding to the user given user ID   from ~/.awsAuth file.   All subsequent S3 and SQS operations will use these crendentials.
This function must be called before the first SQS or S3 operation.   It could be called again when the credential switch is required.

See [DevGuide#Authentication_Keys Developer's Guide] for details about ‘~/.awsAuth’ file.

===aws_set_debug====

_void *aws_set_debug* 	( int 	*d*  )  _	


Enable debugging output.

Parameters:
    	d 	non-zero causes debugging output to be printed

This function controls whether debugging output is printer out. Calling it with non-zero parameter causes the debug messages to be printed out.


===aws_set_id====

===aws_set_key===

===aws_set_keyid===




== S3 Interface Functions  ==

==s3_set_host==

*void s3_set_host 	(    char '*'const    str 	 )*

Sets S3 host.  The AWS4C sets the default host to ‘s3.amazonaws.com’ ,  you only need to call this function if you want to use different Simple Storage Services host.

==s3_set_bucket==

* void s3_set_bucket 	( 	char '*'const   	str 	 )  *	


Select current S3 bucket.  All subsequent S3 operations will be performed on this bucket.

Parameters:
    	str 	bucket ID

==s3_get==

*int s3_get 	( IOBuf '*'  	b,  char '*' const   	file) *			

Downloads the  file from the current bucket and  places the data into the I/O buffer.

Parameters:
    	b 	I/O buffer
    	file 	filename

Returns: 
            0 on success or an error code on failure.  Also check the return code in I/O buffer. See [DevGuide#Checking_results_of_AWS_operation Checking results of AWS operation].

==s3_put==

*int s3_put   ( 	IOBuf '*'  	b, char '*' const   	fill )*

Upload the file into currently selected bucket, takes the data from I/O buffer.  

Parameters:
    	b 	I/O buffer
    	file 	filename

Returns: 
            0 on success or an error code on failure.  Also check the return code in I/O buffer. See [DevGuide#Checking_results_of_AWS_operation Checking results of AWS operation].
