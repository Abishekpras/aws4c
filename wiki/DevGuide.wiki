==Authentication Keys==

AWS4C uses `~/.awsAuth` file for retrieving AWS credentials the `.awsAuth` has the format similar to UNIX `passwd` file.  Each line of the file should contain the following items,  user ID,  AWS Key ID, and AWS Key. The items should be separated by colon ':'.   The first item of each line the user ID parameter is a record identifier.  The record identifier is used by `aws_read_config` function to the AWS key  id and the value to be used  by the library.  The sample code supplied with this library uses ID 'sample'
Make sure to configure this ID in your `.awsAuth` file before running the  example programs.

Note the `.awsAuth` file should be owned by the user who is executing the  program and should have permissions such that it is only readable by the owner.
 
Here is an example of the file:

{{{
id:1XASDSDSDSAMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE
user2:1X35D84SD9AMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE
sample:1XA39S3xwSAMPLE:IK234jJk3454543SAMPLE
}}}
